#5 Day Project - SCHOOL.IO                               [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zpfled/schoolio.svg?branch=master)][1][![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/zpfled/schoolio/badge.png)][2]
##MVP

- build a simple app in which users (students) can enter their grades and track progress over time
- students can log in with a secure password, view a chart of their progress in a given subject, and that's pretty much it for now
